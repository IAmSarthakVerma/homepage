## Other thoughts

```
Unimagined

Colors spread unevenly
We cluster our imagination 
to visualize a pattern

Words spread incoherently 
to imagine a poem

Stars spread in the dark night
We imagine constellation

Death walks away on a random path
leaving us to imagination

In a deep corner
we constantly
stretch ourselves
and 
tussle with our imagined world
