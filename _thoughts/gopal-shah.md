Some people come into our lives, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never the same. What an amazing person,You touched so many lives for the good. Mrutyunjay Mishra (known as M2 in friends circle) vision of life was remarkable. He was indeed an inspiration to us all.He always had a calming effect on everyone around him.
 Nothing is more painful in life as the separation of a jewel. I feel I have lost a great  friend, a mentor , a guide , a colleague…….someone special in every possible way. A person that departs from this earth never truly leaves, for they are still alive in our hearts, through us, they live on.
 We were friends of M2. The WORLD  won’t be the same without him. M2 will be missed .I cannot believe you are no longer with us… I have to believe that God has bigger plans for you.Death can never take a good man away, for, in the hearts of the people he inspired, the legacy remains and continuous throughout generations. 
 I will forever cherish his friendship,mentor ship, leadership and guidance. I will carry him forever in my heart.
 
 I’m grateful I had the chance to spend his last few hours with me as a cherished friend.
 M2 was such a great person, He will live on in our memories forever.Words fall short of expressing my sorrow
