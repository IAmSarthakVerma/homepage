I knew Mratunjay from Parent community of Prakriti school. He was all heart. He always took extra initiative to bring us together even outside the school. It is the fruit of his initial efforts that our parents group has emerged to become a group of lifelong friends. I was also acquainted with his philosophy of business which was unique and made him great entrepreneur. May God rest his soul and give his family to bear this moment of sorrow. Needless to say me and my family will always be there for Julie, jay, Pahi and Zoye.
