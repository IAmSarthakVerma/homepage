May the noble soul rest in peace.Lost a family member, a great and dynamic thinker, a gem in the family of Artta Bhaina and Bhouja and a lovable soul. Pray almighty to give strength to the bereaved family.All his friends and well wishers should join together to fulfil his dreams as far as practicable.The youngest brother has done his job in completing the rituals at Allahabad. Now he should take care of his parents at home. God bless all.
Om Shanti
