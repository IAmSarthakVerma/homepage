My deepest condolences Dr. Julie and your family for our loss. Keep up your strength as you navigate thru the ups and downs of life. I am not able to make it to MM's prayer meeting as I'm in Malaysia. May God rest his soul in peace. MM will always be in my heart. MM and myself had a great bonding in the  backend and kept in touch till his last few days. We almost spoke twice a week for long hours brainstorming on his crazy ideas which I used to patiently hear but get him back to the 1st idea he started with. He was indeed an ocean of ideas and a  chatterbox which I will definitely miss.
